In this projecct, I analyze studentsâ€™ performance on tests affected by several variables. I started off by visualizing the data using box plots, cat plots, histograms, etc. After this was completed, I used decision trees to determine the optimal classification of the data. Once the preliminary decision tree has been created, the program optimizes it using confusion matrices and cross-validation to yield more consistently accurate predictions.
Below is a list of all the variables affecting test scores:
-Gender
-Race/Ethnicity
-Parental Levels of Education
-Whether they recieve free or reduced lunches
-Whethehr or not they take a test preparation course
The data is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
