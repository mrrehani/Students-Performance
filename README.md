In this project, I analyze studentsâ€™ performance on tests affected by several variables. I started off by visualizing the data using box plots, cat plots, histograms, etc. After this was completed, I used decision trees to determine the optimal classification of the data. Once the preliminary decision tree has been created, the program optimizes it using confusion matrices and cross-validation to yield more consistently accurate predictions.<br />
Below is a list of all the variables affecting test scores:<br />
-Parental Levels of Education<br />
-Whether they recieve free or reduced lunches<br />
-Whether or not they take a test preparation course<br />
-Gender <br />
The data is from here: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams
